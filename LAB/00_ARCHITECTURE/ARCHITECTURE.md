# ARCHITECTURE — Auditable Construction System

## Status

**ACTIVE — Canonical project architecture**

## Purpose

This file defines the permanent engineering architecture of the transparent mathematical construction.

The project is represented as an **auditable dependency graph**, not as a linear sequence of documents.

### Mandatory graph-topology specialization

For the canonical operational interpretation of serial dependencies, horizontal independence, parallel convergence, branching, and branch reconvergence, every human or AI collaborator must also read:

```text
LAB/00_ARCHITECTURE/CONSTRUCTION_TOPOLOGY.md
```

That document is authoritative for graph-topology questions under this architecture. In particular:

```text
construction DAG ≠ forced linear chain
fork ≠ Decision Point by default
meeting ≠ verified Junction by default
reconvergence preserves branch provenance
```

The current program gives particular attention to scientifically meaningful:

```text
split → independent development → verified reconvergence
```

patterns when the mathematics naturally supports them.

This specialization was adopted through:

```text
PDSA-ARCH-001 — Construction Topology Adoption
```

The construction objective is:

```text
declared pre-numerical constructional starting point
        ↓
explicit construction
        ↓
constructed mathematical structure
        ↓
explicit formalization boundary
        ↓
formal realization
        ↓
natural numbers
        ↓
integers → rationals → reals → complex numbers
```

The diagram is a target architecture, not a requirement that every local dependency graph be linear.

## Governing research method

New research work follows:

> **PDSA — Plan, Do, Study, Act**

Historical paths or files containing `PDCA` are legacy provenance only.

The governing correction and methodology record is:

`LAB/BOMA_PDSA_GOVERNANCE_AND_PDCA_LEGACY_CORRECTION_2026-08-18.md`

PDSA produces two linked outputs:

```text
CONSTRUCTION OUTPUT
mathematical units and their dependency graph

LEARNING OUTPUT
errors, successes, corrections, methodological lessons, decision criteria,
and human–AI research learning
```

### Learning-to-Construction integration rule

A verified Learning-Graph result is not required to remain permanently outside
the Construction DAG. When an experiment closes successfully and the owner
explicitly authorizes architectural integration, the **knowledge established by
the experiment** may become permanent Construction-DAG knowledge.

Permitted integration forms include:

```text
refine an existing dependency contract;
preserve a verified non-selected route as a permanent alternative branch;
preserve a verified reconvergence as a permanent Junction;
expose a representation-independent reusable contribution;
record a new sensitivity/reopening/genericity condition.
```

The following implications are forbidden:

```text
permanent DAG visibility ≠ SELECTS
permanent DAG visibility ≠ ACCEPTED EXPORT
verified alternative ≠ canonical producer
successful experiment ≠ automatic acceptance promotion
```

Thus the Construction Graph may contain both the selected canonical route and
verified non-selected alternatives. The Learning Graph continues to preserve
**how** those facts were discovered, including Frozen Plans, failed attempts,
exact evidence, Study/Act decisions, and owner authorization.

If integration changes `SELECTS`, replaces an accepted Block/export, or adds a
new accepted Claim, that requires a separate explicit Decision/acceptance action
and corresponding verification. Architectural learning integration alone has no
such authority.

The first owner-authorized application of this rule is:

`LAB/PDSA/STAGE_TWO_SUCCESSFUL_EXPERIMENTS_ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION_001.md`.

## Canonical unit types

### Brick

The smallest independently reviewable and changeable mathematical construction unit at the declared project granularity.

A Brick must have:

- unique ID;
- explicit inputs;
- explicit construction rule or declared constraint;
- explicit outputs/effect;
- invariants;
- operational status;
- verification status/evidence;
- epistemic status;
- dependencies;
- sensitivity/change impact;
- relevant PDSA provenance when created or changed under the current method.

A Brick's graph orientation does not determine whether it is a Brick. A Brick may be dependency-free, vertically dependent, horizontally independent of sibling units, branch-specific, or one of several contributors to a convergent downstream unit.

### Block

A coherent cluster of Bricks that establishes one higher-level structure.

A Block has:

- input interface;
- internal Bricks or declared internal construction components;
- internal relations;
- output interface;
- acceptance criterion;
- operational and epistemic status;
- PDSA provenance where applicable.

A Block may contain serial or parallel internal structure. Composition must preserve Brick identities and provenance.

### Junction

A **compatibility / convergence gate** where construction paths, representations, interfaces, or constraints must be reconciled before downstream promotion.

A Junction is not the unit used merely to choose among admissible alternatives.

A Junction must record:

- incoming units;
- compatibility condition;
- identification/translation rule where applicable;
- shared output or admitted downstream transition;
- possible conflicts/failure modes;
- verification status;
- operational status;
- epistemic status;
- sensitivity and reopening conditions.

A Junction may reconcile branches that arose from a Decision Point or combine parallel non-alternative contributions. A visual meeting of paths is not sufficient evidence of convergence.

### Decision Point

An explicit architectural unit recording a **non-derived selection problem** between two or more admissible methodological, foundational, representational, logical, or formalization alternatives.

A Decision Point exists when the project must choose a route and the choice is not already forced by a proved compatibility/derivability result.

A Decision Point must record:

- unique ID;
- incoming dependencies and the question requiring a choice;
- admissible options/branches with distinct identities or explicit option IDs;
- `ALTERNATIVE_TO` relations where applicable;
- evaluation criteria;
- new commitments introduced by each option;
- current operational status (`OPEN`, `RESOLVED / SELECTED`, etc.);
- selected option if resolved;
- epistemic status of the selection, normally `DECLARED CHOICE`, `METHODOLOGICAL CHOICE`, or `FORMALIZATION-DEPENDENT` rather than `DERIVED`;
- rationale and PDSA evidence;
- downstream consequences;
- reopening/sensitivity conditions;
- preservation status of non-selected alternatives.

A selected option does not become mathematically necessary merely because it is the canonical route.

### Configuration

A mathematical or constructional object produced by one or more construction units.

A document describing a configuration is not the configuration itself.

## Canonical graph relations

Only these graph relations are admitted unless the architecture is explicitly revised:

```text
DEPENDS_ON
COMPOSES
REFINES
VERIFIES
CONSTRAINS
ALTERNATIVE_TO
MEETS_AT
REPRESENTS
BRANCHES_TO
SELECTS
```

### Decision relations

```text
DecisionPoint --BRANCHES_TO--> Option
DecisionPoint --SELECTS-----> SelectedOption
```

`SELECTS` records a project choice. It must never be interpreted as `DERIVES`.

Non-selected options remain traceable and may later become verified permanent
alternative branches without becoming selected.

### Topology interpretation

The same relation vocabulary may participate in different graph topologies:

```text
serial dependency
horizontal independence
parallel convergence
Decision Point branching
exploratory branching
verified reconvergence through Junctions
permanent verified alternative branches learned through PDSA
```

The detailed rules and fork taxonomy are defined by `CONSTRUCTION_TOPOLOGY.md`.

## Operational status

Operational status records where a unit is in the active project lifecycle and graph. Typical values include:

```text
ACTIVE
OPEN
RESOLVED / SELECTED
PASS / RESOLVED
CONDITIONAL / PENDING
RESERVED
REJECTED
ARCHIVED
```

Operational status answers questions such as:

- Is the unit currently part of the active graph?
- Is it blocked at a gate?
- Is it an unresolved Decision Point?
- Has an option been selected for the canonical route?
- Is its identity only reserved for future work?
- Has it been rejected or archived?

## Verification levels

```text
V0  idea
V1  explicit construction
V2  local verification
V3  dependency-compatible verification
V4  cross-path verification
V5  formal verification under selected regime
```

Verification level is not the same as operational or epistemic status.

## Epistemic status

Epistemic status records **how the content is justified**, independently of whether the unit is operationally active.

Every active unit or explicit subclaim must declare, where applicable, one of:

```text
CONSTRUCTED
DERIVED
DECLARED CHOICE
METHODOLOGICAL CHOICE
FORMALIZATION-DEPENDENT
PENDING
REJECTED
```

A declared additional constraint can be operationally ACTIVE while epistemically a DECLARED CHOICE until/unless a later proof reclassifies its current-path role.

A Decision Point selection is normally not a theorem; its status must remain a choice unless necessity is independently proved.

## Status-separation invariant

The following dimensions must not be collapsed:

```text
Operational Status
Verification Status / Evidence
Epistemic Status
```

Historical example:

```text
TCT-BR-009
Earlier state under incomplete ≈:
  Operational Status = ACTIVE
  Epistemic Status   = DECLARED CHOICE — ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINT

Current path after BR-010 / PDSA-TCT-004:
  Operational Status = ACTIVE
  Epistemic Status   = DERIVED UNDER TCT-BR-010
```

The earlier state remains provenance rather than being rewritten away.

## Sensitivity rule

Every Brick and every high-impact Block/Junction/Decision Point must answer:

```text
If this unit or selection changes:

What remains valid upstream?
Which descendants require retesting?
Which sibling/alternative units may become active or incompatible?
Which Junctions must be reopened?
Which Decision Points must be reconsidered?
Which PDSA results or learning claims must be revisited?
```

For reconvergent structures, sensitivity analysis must also identify whether a change invalidates only one branch, the Junction proof, or the shared downstream contribution.

## Architectural invariants

1. No unit may silently replace another unit.
2. Alternatives receive distinct IDs or explicit versioned revisions when identity is intentionally preserved.
3. A Junction may not hide an unresolved incompatibility.
4. A Decision Point may not present a selected option as a derived necessity without proof.
5. A pending result cannot become accepted because a downstream document exists.
6. Historical material is preserved when scientifically relevant.
7. Geometry or visualization is a representation unless explicitly promoted to mathematical structure.
8. Numerical concepts are not used as hidden premises in the pre-numerical object layer.
9. The pre-numerical layer is not metatheory-free; its meta-level resources must be declared.
10. Construction is distinguished from numerical/algebraic interpretation.
11. Operational status, verification status, and epistemic status remain distinct.
12. Scientifically relevant failures and corrections remain traceable through PDSA learning records.
13. AI-generated content never becomes canonical solely because it is fluent or plausible; appropriate verification and human research authority remain explicit.
14. Non-selected Decision Point options remain traceable for later branch comparison unless explicitly rejected for a documented reason.
15. Repository or document order must not be treated as mathematical dependency order.
16. Independent horizontal units must not be forced into false dependencies for presentation convenience.
17. A fork must be classified before it is represented as a Decision Point.
18. Reconvergence requires explicit evidence and an appropriate Junction/compatibility record.
19. Reconvergence does not erase branch provenance or imply identical construction histories.
20. Same reusable certified contribution may have multiple distinct producer paths, provided their convergence/translation is explicitly verified.
21. A successful experiment may refine the permanent Construction DAG only through an explicit Study/Act classification and owner-authorized integration action.
22. Integrating verified knowledge does not by itself promote a producer, change `SELECTS`, or change an accepted export.
23. A verified non-selected route may remain permanently visible in the Construction DAG with its distinct evidence and provenance.
24. When a successful experiment demonstrates a smaller sufficient dependency interface, the architectural dependency contract should record that minimal mathematical surface even if legacy implementation bundles remain larger.

## Repository structure

Current canonical structure:

```text
LAB/
├── 00_ARCHITECTURE/
├── 10_CONSTRUCTION/
│   ├── blocks/
│   ├── bricks/
│   ├── junctions/
│   ├── decisions/
│   └── experiments/
├── 20_FORMALIZATION/
└── 90_ARCHIVE/
```

The PDSA research-process record is maintained separately under:

```text
LAB/PDSA/
```

Repository-level handoff/discovery files:

```text
README.md
AGENTS.md
```

`00_ARCHITECTURE` defines the active construction system.

`10_CONSTRUCTION` contains active construction units, gates, and explicit Decision Points.

`20_FORMALIZATION` contains explicit formal realizations.

`90_ARCHIVE` contains historical or superseded material when migrated there intentionally.

`PDSA` records cumulative research cycles and learning. A PDSA record is not itself automatically a canonical mathematical unit.

## Authority rule

The sequence of documents is only a **view** of the construction graph.

The canonical graph and unit identities are authoritative for mathematical construction status.

`LAB/00_ARCHITECTURE/CONSTRUCTION_TOPOLOGY.md` is authoritative for the operational interpretation of serial/parallel/fork/reconvergence topology.

PDSA cycle records are authoritative for the recorded research process and learning associated with those cycles, subject to later additive correction rather than silent rewriting.

## PDSA-N-002 architectural revision note

The explicit `Decision Point` unit type and `BRANCHES_TO` / `SELECTS` relations were added when the project reached its first major formal-realization choice.

This restores a core BOMA concept to the canonical engineering architecture rather than hiding formalization choices inside narrative text.

## PDSA-ARCH-001 architectural revision note

`PDSA-ARCH-001 — Construction Topology Adoption` consolidated prior Brick/Block/DAG/branch learning into the explicit canonical topology rules in:

```text
LAB/00_ARCHITECTURE/CONSTRUCTION_TOPOLOGY.md
```

It also established `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` as mandatory repository-level handoff entry points.

## BOMA-ST2-LEARNING-INTEGRATION-001 architectural revision note

Owner-authorized integration of `ST2-EXP-001..003` established that successful
experiment knowledge may become permanent Construction-DAG knowledge without
rewriting Decision selection or accepted exports. The authoritative Act is:

`LAB/PDSA/STAGE_TWO_SUCCESSFUL_EXPERIMENTS_ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION_001.md`.
